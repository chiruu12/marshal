# Marshal

Orchestration engine for driving a **fleet of headless coding agents** (Cursor CLI, OpenCode,
Codex, Google Antigravity now; Gemini later) from one "driver" agent (e.g. Claude Code). The driver
plans; Marshal spawns and manages the fleet in isolated git worktrees, in parallel, and reports
back — exposed as an **MCP server + Skills**, with **per-provider usage tracking**.

Marshal is the **infrastructure layer**. A future, separate product (**Chauffeur**) — an end-user
autonomous coding system — will be built on top of Marshal. See `docs/chauffeur-future.md`. Keep
Marshal clean and embeddable.

> **Current status:** full vertical slice built (engine → service → CLI → MCP); suite green.
> `collect_run`/`integrate` and **Phase 1 cost-proof** shipped (`docs/plans/phase1-cost-proof.md`).
> Next: **Phase 2 solidify**, then parallel. OpenCode + Cursor live-verified. See `docs/status.md`.

## Tech Stack

Python ≥ 3.11, managed with **uv**. Stdlib-first engine (dataclasses, subprocess, pathlib).
MCP server via the `mcp` SDK (optional extra). Config in YAML. No database — file-based state.

## Development

- Install: `uv sync --extra mcp --extra dev`
- Run CLI: `uv run marshal` (`backends` · `usage` · `status` · `mcp`)
- Test: `uv run pytest`
- Lint: `uv run ruff check src tests && uv run mypy`
- Add deps: `uv add <pkg>` (never edit pyproject.toml deps by hand)

The gate every commit must pass (single-line; `git -C`/`uv --directory` from outside the dir):
`uv --directory . run pytest -q && uv --directory . run ruff check src tests && uv --directory . run mypy`

## Core invariants (do not violate)

- **Every agent run gets an external timeout + kill.** Both Cursor and OpenCode hang in the wild.
- **Headless = no stdin = never use a prompting permission mode** (it deadlocks). Default `safe-edit`.
- **Backend is a per-call parameter**, never a global, never encoded in tool/skill names.
- **`build_invocation` and `map_permission` are pure functions** returning argv — unit-testable
  without spawning processes. Every backend ships contract tests.
- **Tag every usage record with its `source`** (native / admin-api / estimated / scraped /
  unavailable). Never present an estimate as ground truth.
- **Usage/cost is a two-layer split.** The engine stamps *facts* (tokens / cost / duration /
  source) to an immutable ledger (`usage/events.jsonl`); interpretation (cost-per-outcome,
  savings) is *derived on read* in the report layer, never stored. Estimated cost is priced at
  run time (a snapshot), so editing the price table never rewrites history.
- **Worktree isolation** is the safety boundary. Main branch is untouched until explicit integrate.
- The **engine is mechanism**; planning/routing/merge judgment lives in **Skills** (and later
  Chauffeur). Don't put decomposition logic in the engine.

Full architecture, per-backend cheat sheets, permission tables, and the edge-case hardening
checklist are in `docs/design.md`. Read it before implementing a backend.

## Conventions

- Read existing files before creating new ones — match patterns.
- Commit messages: one line, describe WHAT shipped, not how. No process/iteration history.
- Never expose internal process in any public-facing output (commits, PRs, README, docs).
